# Resume Bullet Points - Loan Approval Prediction System

## STAR Method Resume Bullets

Use these powerful, quantified achievements on your resume:

---

### Technical Achievement Bullets

1. **"Built an end-to-end automated loan approval classification system using XGBoost, achieving 85.3% AUC-ROC through Optuna hyperparameter optimization, reducing manual underwriting time by an estimated 60%"**

2. **"Engineered 21 domain-specific credit risk features including Loan-to-Income, Debt-to-Income, and Credit History interactions, improving model discrimination by 12% over baseline logistic regression"**

3. **"Implemented SHAP-based explainability framework for 614+ credit decisions, enabling transparent AI by identifying Credit History as the dominant predictor (30% feature importance)"**

4. **"Designed fairness-aware ML pipeline with Disparate Impact analysis across 4 protected attributes (gender, education, property area), ensuring all metrics remained within fair lending thresholds (DI > 0.8)"**

5. **"Developed production-ready Streamlit web application with real-time predictions, probability gauges, and SHAP explanations, deployable to Streamlit Cloud or HuggingFace Spaces"**

6. **"Trained and evaluated 7 classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) with 5-fold stratified cross-validation"**

---

### ML Engineering Bullets

7. **"Architected modular Python ML pipeline with separate modules for preprocessing, feature engineering, training, evaluation, explainability, and fairness analysis"**

8. **"Implemented automated data preprocessing with domain-aware imputation strategies (median for numerical, mode for categorical) and IQR-based outlier handling"**

9. **"Applied log transformations to skewed income distributions, improving model convergence and reducing the impact of high-income outliers"**

---

### Data Science Bullets

10. **"Conducted comprehensive EDA including Cramér's V for categorical correlations, chi-square tests for feature significance, and t-tests for numerical predictors"**

11. **"Discovered that Credit History alone explains 80%+ approval rate for good credit vs. 8% for bad credit, validating industry credit risk practices"**

---

### Business Impact Bullets

12. **"Delivered FinTech-ready credit risk scoring system with full documentation, enabling faster loan decisions while maintaining regulatory compliance with fair lending requirements"**

13. **"Created academic-quality technical report and GitHub-ready documentation suitable for engineering portfolio, MS/PhD applications, and job interviews"**

## How to Customize

Replace the placeholder metrics with your actual results:
- Update AUC-ROC with your best model's score
- Adjust sample sizes (614+) to your dataset
- Modify feature counts based on your engineering
- Add specific business context from your use case
